### Simplex - is a **math** project for students to solve math problems using simplex method. It can be used for tutorial purposes.

I've wrote it when I was a student in 1995-1996. :pen: :smile:

It is a part of GUI application written in Visual C++ 5.0, but it is not compatible with Windows 7. :unamused:
